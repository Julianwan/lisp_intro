# I'm trying to start with lisp

## Why I want to learn lisp

- Lisp is often referred to as a **one-man** programming language
- It's old and the Lisp enthusiasts seem to think it has magic powers
- It is incredibly powerful
- Some describe it as "speaking with the spirit of the computer" which is a poetic way of saying it is close to the root core of interacting with basic computing interfaces.

### What I hope to acheive

- [ ] The ability to create simple programs that generate new code

#### Running locally

So far this isn't much. Just an idea and a hankering. To run locally ensure you have Roswell, SBCL, and other common lisp stuff installed.

The when open run `ros run` and then you can `(load "main.lisp")` and begin solving simple math problems like `(triple 2)` until I start tinkering with more advanced implementations.
